def predict_health_risks(food_item, ingredients, consumption_frequency):
    prompt = f"""
    As a food safety and health expert, analyze the following food item and its ingredients:

    Food Item: {food_item}
    Ingredients: {', '.join(ingredients)}
    Consumption Frequency: {consumption_frequency}

    Based on this information, please provide:
    1. Potential health risks associated with consuming this food item, especially if consumed in unhealthy amounts.
    2. A list of specific diseases that could arise from regular consumption of this food. Your response MUST include this exact format:
       Most Likely Diseases: [Disease1, Disease2, Disease3]
    3. Any concerning ingredients and their specific health impacts.
    4. How the consumption frequency might affect the likelihood or severity of these health risks.
    5. Rate the impact (0-10 scale) of this food on the following health aspects:
       - Cardiovascular health: [score]
       - Blood sugar levels: [score]
       - Weight management: [score]
       - Digestive health: [score]
       - Nutrient balance: [score]

    Present your analysis in a structured, easy-to-read format with bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.
    Ensure that the 'Most Likely Diseases' list is formatted exactly as shown above, with square brackets and comma-separated values.
