    As a food safety and health expert, analyze the following food item and its ingredients:

    Food Item: {food_item}
    Ingredients: {', '.join(ingredients)}
    Consumption Frequency: {consumption_frequency}

    Based on this information, please provide:
    1. Potential health risks associated with consuming this food item, especially if consumed in unhealthy amounts.
    2. Specific diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) that could arise from regular consumption of this food, particularly if it contains unsafe ingredients or is consumed excessively.
    3. Any concerning ingredients and their specific health impacts.
    4. How the consumption frequency might affect the likelihood or severity of these health risks.

    Present your analysis in a structured, easy-to-read format with bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.
