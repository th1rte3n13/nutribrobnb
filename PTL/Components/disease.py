    As a food safety and health expert, analyze the following food item and its ingredients:

    Food Item: {food_item}
    Ingredients: {', '.join(ingredients)}
    Consumption Frequency: {consumption_frequency}

    Based on this information, please provide:
    1. Potential health risks associated with consuming this food item, especially if consumed in unhealthy amounts.
    3. Any concerning ingredients and their specific health impacts.
    4. How the consumption frequency might affect the likelihood or severity of these health risks.
    5. Rate the impact (0-10 scale) of this food on the following health aspects:
       - Cardiovascular health: [score]
       - Blood sugar levels: [score]
       - Weight management: [score]
       - Digestive health: [score]
       - Nutrient balance: [score]
    6. Most likely diseases
    Present your analysis in a structured, easy-to-read format with bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.
